Mainly explain the basic skills that should be mastered as a user (not a developer).

## Requirements

As a coder (Emacs user), I have some requirements as below:
1. I can record notes at any time to complete the daily accumulation.
2. I can simply use the shell function in the editor.
3. I can use the code jump function according to different language.
4. I can use various query functions in a project with version control.
5. I can use grep-like function without version control.
6. I can use the code tagging feature to complete the documentation process.
7. I can use Chinese input-method in any file.
7. I can use version control functions, example: git.
8. To be continue...

NOTE: Use #NUM express requirement's number.

## Meet Plugins or Built-in Functions

Emacs provides built-in features or plugins that meet my requirements.



## Issue
When you get the spacemacs.git master branch from GitHub, and install packages at first time, maybe you have a trouble same as '... name is missspelled?'

Fix it by booting with option '--insecure'
For example: emacs --insecure
